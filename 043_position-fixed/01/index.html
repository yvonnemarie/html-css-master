<!--
This type of positioning is fairly rare but certainly has its uses.

A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself.

The viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled (css-tricks)
