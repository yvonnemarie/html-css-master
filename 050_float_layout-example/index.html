<!--
The float property allows us to take an element, remove it from the normal flow of a page,and position it to the left or right of its parent element. All other elements on the page will then flow around the floated element. An <img> element floated to the side of a few paragraphs of text, for example, will allow the paragraphs to wrap around the image as necessary. (howe)

<!--
When the float property is used on multiple elements at the same time, it provides the ability to create examples by floating elements directly next to or opposite each other, as seen in multiple-column layouts. (howe)-->
